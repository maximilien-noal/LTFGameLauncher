# LTFGameLauncher

Generic Game Launcher, primarly for automated setups hosted at www.abandonware-france.org (aka Lost Treasures Fr).

Put a "manuel.pdf"/"manual.pdf" file along side it to have a "Manuel"/"Manual" button appear.

If a "setup.exe" file exists, a "Setup" button will appear.

The launcher needs to be configured before use (see the config file for details).
